# Student-data



This is a simple student management system built in Python. It lets users easily input information for multiple students, such as their roll number, name, class, and marks for different subjects. You can keep adding subjects and marks for each student, and the system will automatically calculate their average marks. Once all the data is entered, it displays a summary for each student, showing their details and average marks. The system is flexible, so you can enter as many students as you like, making it a handy tool for managing student information in a small-scale setting.

Thank you.
